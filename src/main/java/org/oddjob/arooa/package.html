  <p>Arooa stands for A Rip Off Of Ant, and provides ant like configuration.</p>

  
  <p>Configuration starts with an {@link org.oddjob.arooa.ArooaConfiguration}.
  The most typical is an {@link org.oddjob.arooa.xml.XMLConfiguration}.</p>
  
  <p>An <code>ArooaConfiguration</code> takes and provides an 
  {@link org.oddjob.arooa.parsing.ArooaContext} which is something 
  that brings together
  the result of parsing an 'element' in a configuration and everything required
  to parse child elements if (or when) they exist.</p> 
  <p>The 
  <code>ArooaContext</code> is central to Arooa and provides the framework with
  it's flexibility. Creating one does require some understanding of Arooa but 
  an {@link org.oddjob.arooa.ArooaParser} saves us this need.</p>
